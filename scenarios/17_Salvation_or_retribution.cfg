They can branch into different schools such as necromantic decay, or what you like to call dread, which can significantly empower undead minions and even armies should the necromancer be powerful enough."}

        {SAY MalinGhost "Inverted arcane, also referred to as void magic, is a force of unending hunger for energy. Some believe that when this world was created, all matter contained fragments of arcane energy. Because the void only cares about taking back energy, it consumes anything. Instead of satiating this hunger though, it grows hungrier and bolder."}
