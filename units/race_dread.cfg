    description= _ "Dread are modified undead creatures of various types. This race consists of various types of undead, or those raised by other dread. They use unusual types of magic to bolster their armies, and often have different characteristics, making even the best tacticians confused as to how to counter such a force.
    
Although dread magic is the most commonly used school amongst the dread, it acts mostly as a base school. Unholy magic is a stronger form of dread magic, and a combination of cold magic that taps deeper into necromancy. Soul magic is able to tap into, and manipulate the very soul of a being using primarily arcane magic. Void magic is a mysterious force that represents the very absence of death, and can only be purged with fire or arcane magic. Warped magic, the most destructive of all, makes use of fire and arcane, but is vulnerable to cold magic.

It is believed that such magic was created due to an exploit in the innately volatile characteristics of the arcane. How this was done and used to create other subtypes of dread magic however, is mostly disputed amongst the most talented magical beings, and remains largely unknown."
