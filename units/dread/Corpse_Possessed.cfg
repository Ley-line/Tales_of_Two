    description= _ "A corpse infused with a tremendous amount of soul energy. Those truely profound in the arts of soul magic can accumulate enough souls through the use of Soul Wraiths, and merge them together into one sentient soul. This soul will then possess the body it is fused into, empower it, and in time.. consume it.

Although regular soul magic is often portrayed to have a slight purple or pink radiance; when enough souls are merged into one, it glows brilliantly blue-white in colour. This also makes it much more volatile and unstable. In contrary to Soul Spirits however, it has more influence over raw aspects of the arcane. It is theorized this to be the clashing of primordial forces that make up time itself. Should a being really master the ability to control time, it may well be too late to stop it."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_PLAGUE_STRONG}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE_HASTED}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAINS_ENERGY}
